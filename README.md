# DebugDiary
My personal changelog for becoming a better backend dev — one debug at a time.

# 🐞 DebugDiary

Welcome to **DebugDiary** — my personal logbook of daily dev progress, bug battles, and backend breakthroughs.  
Powered by Python and a strong cup of coffee ☕️, this repo helps me stay on track as I build, learn, and grow as a backend developer.

---

## 📌 What's this?

This is a **daily to-do list and progress tracker** for improving my developer portfolio — with a special focus on:

- 🐍 **Python** (my language of choice)
- 🔧 **Backend development**
- 🧪 **Testing & Debugging**
- 🗂️ **Project architecture**
- 📡 **APIs and Integrations**
- ☁️ **Cloud tools & DevOps basics**

## 🛠️ How I Use This Repo

Each day, I update this repository with:

- ✅ Tasks to complete
- 🚧 Work in progress
- 🧠 Notes or lessons learned
- 🐛 Bugs I’ve encountered (and how I fixed them)
- 💡 Ideas for portfolio projects

This helps me track my evolution, spot patterns, and stay motivated!

I'm currently using Obsidian to keep my records. The files are stored in `/obsidian_vault/`, and since they're in `.md` format, it makes everything easier to manage.
